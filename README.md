# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to predict the status of loan applications using various algorithms from the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries including: 
- Oversampling Methods (Naive Random Oversampling, SMOTE Oversampling)
- Undersampling Methods (Cluster Centroids)
- SMOTEEN
- and Ensemble Learners (Balanced Random Forest Classifier, and Easy Ensemble Classifier)
 
Data is taken from *LoanStats_2019Q1.csv*, and analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebook.
